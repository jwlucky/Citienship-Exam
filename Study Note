Parliamentary democracy : 议会制民主
passing laws, approving and monitoring expenditures, and keeping the government accountable.
House of Commons - the representative chamber, made up of members of Parliament elected by the people, every 4 years
Provincial & Territorial legislatures
Cabinet ministers - selected by Prime Minister

Parliament 
Sovereign 
represented by Governor General

In each of the 10 provinces, the Sovereign is represented by the Lieutenant Governor
Is appointed by the Governor General on the advice of PM, also normally for 5 years
Senate – appointed by Governor General of the advice of PM and serve until 75
